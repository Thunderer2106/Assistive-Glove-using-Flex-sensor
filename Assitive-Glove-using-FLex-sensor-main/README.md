# Assitive-Glove-using-FLex-sensor

Assistive gloves are a type of wearable technology designed to aid individuals with physical impairments or disabilities in performing daily activities. Equipped with sensors and actuators, these devices can provide feedback and assistance to people with limited hand mobility, Parkinson's disease, or stroke, among and other disabilities. This research paper will explore the system components of the assistive gloves, including the sensorized glove, grasp prediction model, muscle stimulation unit, and custom data acquisition and control unit. Furthermore, the paper will (Donot use future tense)examine the potential benefits of assistive gloves in improving the quality of life for people with disabilities, offering greater independence and autonomy. The use of assistive gloves in rehabilitation centers or homes is discussed, and their lightweight and portable nature is highlighted. Finally, the paper will explores the personalization of assistive gloves for individuals with unique needs, highlighting their potential for personalized care.
